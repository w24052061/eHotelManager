## user stories categorized into Must, Should, and Could priorities:

### Must Have

These are essential features for the app to function properly and meet the primary objectives.

- As a customer, I must be able to register and log in to the app, so I can book rooms and raise complaints.
- As a customer, I must be able to view available rooms to check if a room is available for booking before logging in.
- As a customer, I must be able to make payments securely through an integrated online payment system.
- As a hotel staff member, I must be able to update the status of rooms (Available, Cleaning, Do Not Disturb) to manage room availability.
- As a hotel staff member, I must be able to view and address customer complaints to resolve issues promptly.
- As an admin, I must be able to log in securely to access the staff panel and manage payments, rooms, and customer details.

### Should Have

These features are important but are not critical to the core functionality.

- As a customer, I should receive a booking confirmation notification once the payment is successful.
- As a customer, I should be able to cancel a booking if needed, within the terms defined.
- As a hotel staff member, I should be able to view customer complaints and details to ensure timely resolution.
- As an admin, I should be able to see an overview of all bookings and payments for effective management.
- As a hotel staff member, I should be able to filter rooms based on their status (e.g., Cleaning, Available) for easier room management.

### Could Have

These features would improve user experience but are not essential for the initial version of the app.

- As a customer, I could receive promotions and discounts notifications for special offers or discounts on bookings.
- As a customer, I could be able to view reviews and ratings for rooms or services to make informed booking decisions.
- As a hotel staff member, I could update room availability in real time to ensure that all rooms are accurately marked across the app.
- As an admin, I could generate reports on bookings and payments for analysis and business insights.
